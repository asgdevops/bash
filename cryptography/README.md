# :notebook: BASH Cryptography

## Goal
Provide examples of scripts using different encryption/decryption methods.

# :bookmark_tabs: Table of contents
- [GNU Private Guard (GPG) method](gpg_method.md)
- [Open Secure Socket Layer (OpenSSL) method](openssl_method.md)

### Scripts
| Name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| [b64p.sh](cryptography/scripts/b64p.sh) | Creates a secret file from a password set interactively using the base64 algorithm | 
| [cipher.sh](scripts/cipher.sh) | Encrypts/Decrypts using GPG Symmetric method |
